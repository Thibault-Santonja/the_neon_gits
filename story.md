Story of The Neon GitS
===

## Synopsis
In the future, people will be living massively on an online network with the help of microchips that allow them to connect to it. The secret of this chip's code called "The Neon GitS", is kept in a server called "The Temple" where it is possible to materialize via the chip. This code is and must remain protected as its possibilities are immense. 

Regularly, hackers try to retrieve and crack this code in order to use its infinite possibilities, including its power of mental control over chipped humans or robots and AI's. The "Guardians" are thus there to protect this code from any intrusion attempts.

Since a few days, a rather powerful pirate manages to quickly break the firewalls of the temple to the safe protecting the code. As the Guardian of the Temple, it is your duty to quickly regain control and chase this pirate away...

## Story through the game
- possibility to choose another Guardian (different weapons / abilities)
- retry again and again to get new parts of the story: each time we kill the final boss (the pirate), he tells us something new to understand who is he, why does he want the code, what does he want to do with it...
- possibility to add some philosophical reflexions on AI, natrure, what does it mean to be "alive", cyborg, robots... 
> reference to GitS, Blade Runner... (many SF)
